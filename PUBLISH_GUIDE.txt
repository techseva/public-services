PUBLISHING YOUR APP TO GITHUB
=============================

Great news! I have fixed your code (`script.js`) by embedding your Firebase Key.
Now it is ready to work for EVERYONE.

Step 1: Upload to GitHub
------------------------
1. Go to https://github.com/ and login.
2. Create a "New repository" (e.g., name it "my-app").
3. Click "uploading an existing file".
4. DRAG ALL your files into the box.
   - index.html
   - updates.html
   - gsws.html
   - page.html
   - styles.css
   - script.js (Super important! It has the fix)
   - setup.html (Optional)
5. Click "Commit changes".

Step 2: Turn on GitHub Pages
----------------------------
1. In your new repository menu, click "Settings" (top right tab).
2. On the left sidebar, click "Pages".
3. Under "Branch", change "None" -> "main" (or "master").
4. Click "Save".

Step 3: DONE!
-------------
Wait about 1 minute. GitHub will show you a link at the top (e.g., https://yourname.github.io/my-app/).
Click that link. Your app is now LIVE!

Share that link with anyone. They will see all your buttons and updates.
